    <summary>what is bootstrap container and how does it work ?</summary>

    <p>
      Bootstrap Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap. Bootstrap Containers are very essential and
      basic building blocks of bootstrap that wrap a page’s content. It’s responsible for setting and aligning content
      within it according to viewport or given device. Containers are defined within the container class (.container).
      In other words, we can say that containers are established the width for the layout to give the content. Elements
      and content are added within the container.<br><br>

      Bootstrap has the default class or predefined class is “.container” & “.container-fluid” class for layout.
      Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be
      nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.<br><br>

      by giving class name we can use that.

    <summary>what do you know about the bootstrap grid system ?</summary>

    <p>
      The grid system is based on a combination of containers, rows, and columns.<br><br>
      Containers provide a way to center and horizontally pad your site’s contents.<br><br>
      You can use .container for responsive fixed-width container or .container-fluid for full-width content.<br><br>
      Rows act as wrappers for columns. Each column has horizontal padding (called a gutter) for controlling the space
      between them.<br><br>
      Columns are where you place your content. They are based on a 12-column system, allowing you to create various
      layouts.<br><br>
      Bootstrap’s grid system is built with flexbox, making it fully responsive.
      Columns without a specified width automatically layout as equal-width columns.
