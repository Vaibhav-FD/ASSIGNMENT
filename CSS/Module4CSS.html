    <summary>what are the benefits of using CSS?</summary>

    <p>
      <br>
      CSS saves time − You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a
      style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.
      <br>
      <br>
      Easy maintenance − To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be
      updated automatically.
      <br>
      <br>
      Global web standards − Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So it's a
      good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with future browsers.
      <br>
      <br>
      Platform Independence − The Script offer consistent platform independence and can support latest browsers as well.

    <summary>What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</summary>

    <p>
      <br>
      CSS2 and CSS3 are both versions of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language, but there are some key differences
      between the two.

      <br><br>
      <br>

      CSS2 was released in 1998 and is considered to be a stable and mature version of the language. It includes
      features such as support for media types, cascading and inheritance, and selectors.
      <br><br>
      CSS3, on the other hand, is the latest version of the language and was first introduced in 1999. It includes new
      features such as animations, transitions, and new selectors. It also includes support for responsive design and
      new layout modules such as Flexbox and Grid. CSS3 also allows for better accessibility and more control over
      typography.
      <br><br>
      Additionally, CSS3 is not a singular monolithic release, it is a series of individual modules that are updated and
      released as they reach a certain level of maturity.
      <br><br>
      In summary, CSS3 includes new features and capabilities that were not present in CSS2, making it more powerful and
      versatile for web design and development.
