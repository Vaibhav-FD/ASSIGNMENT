    <summary>what is java script ?</summary>

    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that is used to add dynamic functionality and complex features like
      interactivity , It is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control
      multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.

      <br><br>

      In simpler terms, JavaScript is a language that allows developers to create interactive web pages that respond to
      user actions, without requiring the page to be reloaded from the server. It is a client-side language, meaning
      that it runs on the user’s computer rather than on the server.

    <summary>what is === operator ?</summary>

    <p>The === operator in JavaScript is called the strict equality operator. It checks whether its two operands are
      equal in both value and type.
      <br><br>
      For example, 9 === 9 is true, but "9" === 9 is false, because the string "9" is not the same type as the number 9.

    <summary>what are all the looping structure in java script ?</summary>



    <p>
      Looping structures are ways of repeating a block of code based on a condition. JavaScript supports different kinds
      of loops, such as:

      <br><br>

      for loop: This loop executes a block of code a fixed number of times, or until a specified condition is false. It
      has three expressions: initialization, testing, and increment/decrement. For example:

      <br><br>

      <code>
      <pre>
      // This loop prints the numbers from 1 to 10
    
      for (let i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) { 
        console.log(i); 
      } 
      </pre>
      </code>

      <br>

      while loop: This loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It has only one
      expression: testing. For example:
      <br><br>
      <code>
        <pre>
          // This loop prints the numbers from 1 to 10 

          let i=1; while (i&lt;=10)
          { 
            console.log(i); i++; 
          }
        </pre>
      </code>

      <br>


      do…while loop: This loop
      is similar to the while loop, but it executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition. It
      has two expressions: testing and body. For example:
      <br><br>

      <code>
        <pre>
          // This loop prints the numbers from 1 to 10 

          let i=1; 
          
          do { 
            console.log(i); i++; 
          } while (i &lt;=10);
          
        </pre>
      </code>

    </p>
